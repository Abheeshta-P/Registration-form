# Online Registration Form with Mocked Response

This is a simple online registration form implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery), and PHP. The form allows users to enter their name, email, phone number, and address. Upon submission, the form data is displayed on the same page with a success message, without requiring a page reload. The JavaScript also simulates the server-side processing and response.

## Features

- **Form Fields**: Name, Email, Phone, and Address.
- **Validation**: All fields are required.
- **No Page Reload**: The form is submitted via AJAX, and the response is shown on the same page.
- **Mocked Server Response**: For testing purposes, the server-side PHP request is mocked using JavaScript to simulate a real backend response.
- **Styled Interface**: Simple and clean UI with minimal styling.
